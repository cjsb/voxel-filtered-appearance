Repository for **"Voxel-based Representations for Improved Filtered Appearance"**, published at **HPG 2023** by Caio Brito, Pierre Poulin, Veronica Teichrieb

## Installation

To use our code in your projects you will need to add [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), [EIGEN](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and [pcg32](https://github.com/wjakob/pcg32) to your project.

After that, include all '.h' files to your project. The representations (Virtual Mesh and Subgrig of Opacities) can be found in 'representations.h' file.

## Usage

See 'main.cpp' contains an example on how to use our code to build the representation and how to use it in shading and to compute occlusion.
